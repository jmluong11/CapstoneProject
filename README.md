<h1> Capstone: Zero Trust Architecture Implementation at Jotoan Financial Services (JFS)</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This capstone project presents the design and implementation of a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) for a simulated hybrid-cloud financial services organization, Jotoan Financial Services (JFS). The initiative was developed as the final requirement for the Master of Science in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at Western Governors University.

Using industry-standard frameworks including NIST SP 800-207, CISAâ€™s Zero Trust Maturity Model v2.0, and the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the project addressed legacy access control risks, overprivileged accounts, and lack of centralized monitoring. The solution was deployed across four phases: assessment, identity and access hardening, threat detection, and governance.

Microsoftâ€™s security stackâ€”Azure AD, Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Identity, and Privileged Identity Management (PIM)â€”was used to implement identity-centric controls, real-time telemetry, and just-in-time access elevation. The architecture eliminated standing administrative privileges, enforced multi-factor authentication, and centralized SIEM operations.

Evaluation of the solution demonstrated maturity improvements in three of five Zero Trust pillars and delivered measurable enhancements to access governance, threat visibility, and regulatory alignment (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOX). Governance documentation, an ADFS decommissioning plan, and stakeholder-aligned workflows were included to support long-term operational sustainability.</p>

<h2>ðŸ“Œ Project Scope </h2>
<p>The objective of this project was to implement a scalable Zero Trust Architecture for a hybrid-cloud financial institution, Jotoan Financial Services (JFS). The project addressed identity governance weaknesses, administrative access overexposure, and lack of threat visibility using Microsoft security solutions.
